# SNIP for fewshot generalization and multi-task/ continual learning

This repository presents a comprehensive study of SNIP pruning in low-data and continual-learning settings. It includes experiments on few-shot learning, transfer learning with pretrained models, and catastrophic forgetting using SNIP-based EWC and PackNet approaches. All results are benchmarked on CIFAR-100 using ResNet, VGG, WideResNet, and SimpleConv architectures.
